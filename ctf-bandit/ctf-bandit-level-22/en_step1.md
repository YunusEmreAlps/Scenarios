# ![Bandit Level 22](https://github.com/YunusEmreAlps/Scenarios/blob/master/ctf-bandit/assets/Bandit22.png?raw=true)

---

## Level Goal

A program is running automatically at regular intervals from *cron*, the time-based job scheduler. Look in */etc/cron.d/* for the configuration and see what command is being executed.

``` {.sh}
  - Host: bandit.labs.overthewire.org
  - Port: 2220
```

### Commands you may need to solve this level

``` {.sh}
  cron, crontab, crontab(5) (use “man 5 crontab” to access this)
```
