# Bandit Level 17

---

## Level Goal

The credentials for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to *a port on localhost in the range 31000 to 32000*. First find out which of these ports have a server listening on them. Then find out which of those speak SSL and which donâ€™t. There is only 1 server that will give the next credentials, the others will simply send back to you whatever you send to it.

``` {.sh}
  - Host: bandit.labs.overthewire.org

```
